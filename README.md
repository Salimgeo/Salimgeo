My name is Alexander.
- 🏫 I study cartography and geoinformatics in Olomouc, Czechia (Palackého University, Faculty of Science)
- More important is that I like cartography and functional design and I'm not studying because I want a title.


- 🌱 what I can do:
  - data visualization (thematic cartography)
  - geoprocessing tools
  - data vectorization (including georeferencing)
  - geolocating
  - work with OSM data
  - DEMs (digital elevation models)
  - Network Analyses
  - ArcGIS Pro Model Builder, QGIS Model Designer

- 🔧 SW and language knowledge
  - ArcGIS Pro 3.0
  - QGIS 3.40
  - Inkscape, GIMP
  - HTML, CSS
  - Python
  - MS Office (including MS Access)
  - other I use a lot: OBS Studio, DaVinci Resolve, FL Studio
 
- 💬 Ask me about possibilities of mapping methods and functional **map design**. There are more options everytime!
- If the map looks nice it doesn't mean it's easy to read! If the map is easy to read but  it is not attractive to readers, general public will not use it!

- ⚡ Other hobbies: drums, juggling, hiking, geography games

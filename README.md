My name is Alexander.
- 🏫 I study cartography and geoinformatics in Olomouc, Czechia (Palackého University, Faculty of Science)
- More important is that I like cartography and functional design and I'm not studying because I want a title.


- 🌱 what I can do:
  - ArcGIS Pro 3.0
  - QGIS 3.34
  - data visualization (thematic cartography)
  - geoprocessing tools
  - data vectorization (including georeferencing)
  - geolocating
  - DEMs (digital elevation models)
  - work with OSM data
  - ArcGIS Model Builder, QGIS Model Designer
  - for map design finalization: Inkscape, GIMP
  - basics of Python, SQL
 
- 💬 Ask me about possibilities of mapping methods and functional **map design**. Everytime there are more options.
- If the map looks nice it doesn't mean it's easy to read! If the map is easy to read but is not attractive to readers, general public will not use it!

- ⚡ Other hobbies: drums, juggling, hiking, geography games
